Model developed by GAMA platform, 3D printed map of the area, video projecot and an Android Application**
# _Section II presents a review of related works._
# _Section III describes the agent-based model. (Overview, Design concepts, Details) ODD protocol_
# _Section IV presents how the tangible interface works._
# _Section V presents the simulation results._
# _Section VI concludes and proposes possible future developments._
