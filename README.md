**<p>Here is the introduction of the HoanKiemAir Project : an agent-based model which can simulate traffic and the consequent air pollution in the Hoan Kiem district area
in exploring multiple scenarios
it can not only serve as a decision-support tool, but also provide information and raise public awareness about the current situation !
Model developed by GAMA platform, 3D printed map of the area, video projecot and an Android Application</p>**
_<p>Section II presents a review of related works.</p>_
_<p>Section III describes the agent-based model. (Overview, Design concepts, Details) ODD protocol</p>_
_<p>Section IV presents how the tangible interface works.</p>_
_<p>Section V presents the simulation results.</p>_
_<p>Section VI concludes and proposes possible future developments.</p>_
